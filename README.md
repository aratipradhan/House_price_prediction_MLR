🚀 Exciting News: I’ve Just Launched My New House Price Prediction App! 🏡💡
The real estate market can be unpredictable, but with the power of Machine Learning, we can cut through the uncertainty! 🎯 After weeks of hard work and fine-tuning, I’m thrilled to introduce my House Price Prediction App — a tool designed to make estimating house prices easier, faster, and much more accurate. 🎉
🌟 How does it work? Built using Multiple Linear Regression, this app predicts house prices based on multiple key property features, such as:

🏠 Number of Bedrooms: A vital factor that reflects living space and family size.
🌳 Lot Size: Gives insight into outdoor space and potential for expansion.
🏛️ House Condition: Users can rate the property’s condition to adjust value estimates accordingly.
🌇 Number of Floors and Above Ground Area: Captures the usability of the living space, especially for multi-story homes.
With just a few clicks, users can input these details into a beautiful, interactive interface designed using Streamlit and get instant, real-time price predictions. It’s fast, reliable, and incredibly easy to use! 🖥️
